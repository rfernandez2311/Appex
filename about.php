                    <p class="flow-text">The service in which they rent out supplies, such as resistors, protoboards,
                        mice, etc., can be
                        improved.
                        As it stands, it is entirely reliant on them being available, the materials being available,
                        and having to deliver them gets them out of the office and unable to help others in such
                        moments.
                        This can be for individuals, and for entire groups of students.We propose the implementation of
                        a robotic,
                        semi-autonomous, solution for the delivery of said items. To achieve this,
                        we will design and implement a mobile and web app so that users may request items, a database to
                        keep track of inventory,
                        a scheduler for instructions, and of course the robot itself.
                        The robot will use its sensors and instructions received to navigate to various different
                        classrooms to deliver materials.
                        The application will also help Javier and Pedro keep track of which materials are being used by
                        whom,
                        and how many of that do they have available. With our solution, we will not only solve this
                        problem,
                        but improve the service in general that is currently being given to both students and professors
                        alike..</p>
